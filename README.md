LESSON 1: Bits, Bytes, and Data Types! 

In this lesson I cover what Bits and Bytes are before
delving into basic C++ data types.

# Topics:
What are Bits and Bytes?
A BIT is the smallest unit of storage in a computer.
It is a 'bit' of information. A bit can be either a
0 or a 1. Example: there are 3 bits in this sentence- 0 1 0"

A BYTE is the next step up from a bit and contains 8
bits of information. When thinking of bits vs bytes,
imagine that you take a bite(byte) of bits.
Byte Example Sentence: 01100110. 
A single byte can contain a single character, like
the letter 'a or A'.

# What are the basic (primitive) data types?
INT or INTEGER: contains 4 bytes and are whole numbers between
-2147483648 to 2147483647.
CHAR or CHARACTER: contains 1 byte and are a single character
value between -128 to 127 or 0 to 255. Basically, a letter or 
symbol can be stuffed in one way or another into a char.
BOOl or BOOLEAN: contains 1 byte and is a value between 0 and 1(or above).
0 is false and 1(or above) equates to true. The "boolalpha" flag allows
us to assing "true" or "false". 
FLOAT or FLOATING POINT: contains 4 bytes and are decimal numbers
of up to 7 places right of the decimal point. 4.1234567
DOUBLE or DOUBLE FLOATING POINT: contains 8 bytes and are decimal numbers
of up to 15 places right of the decimal point. 6.123456789012345
VOID exists but we don't usually assign it to a variable, therefore, it
is ignored at this point.

# Purpose
The purpose of this program is to instruct a new user
in primitive data types and to allow them to see how code
can work. It is part of a youtube tutorial video.
